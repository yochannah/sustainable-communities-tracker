I again struggle to understand the questions from your questionnaire. How can I control whether contributors have been paid and how do I know what will happen in the future. As a freelancer it is actually a good thing to have the software depend on me, because that creates a business opportunity, which in turn is the sustainability model of my software. If there would be a developers community there would be no business model and the software would no longer be sustainable, because it is unclear who will coordinate and pay those contributors.
